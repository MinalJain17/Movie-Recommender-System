# Objective 

The aim of this project is to create a web-based recommendation system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. These recommendations will be based on user preferences related to movie overviews, genres, and the cast and crew, ultimately presenting the top 5 most relevant movie suggestions.

# Data Description

Two datasets sourced from Kaggle are employed in this project, both originally obtained from the TMDB website. The first dataset, comprises information such as movie genres, overviews, and taglines. The second dataset, contains details about the cast and crew members associated with each movie.
